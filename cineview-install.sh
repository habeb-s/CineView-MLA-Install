# CineView MLA Smart Installer - Design & Development by habeb-s (c) 2026
# One installer for OpenATV, OpenBH and OpenViX.  Usage on the receiver (telnet / ssh):
#   wget -qO /tmp/cineview-install.sh "<distribution point>/cineview-install.sh" && sh /tmp/cineview-install.sh
# options:  DRYRUN=1  checks only      HDD_CACHE=0  keep the poster cache off the hard disk
#           RESTART=1 restart the GUI at the end without asking
#           ROLLBACK=1  return to the previous released version for this image (SHA256-verified, settings kept)
#           PKG_DIR=<folder>  install from package files copied to the receiver (USB / local), same SHA256 check
# Every check runs before anything is changed; any failure stops the installer and nothing is changed.
INSTALLER_VERSION="1.2.2"
PKG="enigma2-plugin-skins-cineview-fhd-mla"
# One package per image, built from the same CineView MLA source (Common Core + image adapter).  Only these exact
# files are ever installed: each is pinned by its SHA256 here, in the installer itself (a download is never trusted
# by its address).  Tested image versions only: OpenATV 8.0, OpenBH 5.6, OpenViX 6.9 (user decision 2026-10-08).
# Distribution point: the packages are assets of one GitHub release, <DIST_BASE>/<file> (not in any repository
# tree).  Empty = not published: then only PKG_DIR (local copies) can be used;
# no address is ever guessed.
